# simple-sim
A simplified vanilla js version of the Electron QB Sim, created to get my head around the logic.

So vanilla that it'd go great with mashed up oreo cookies. If you'd like to run it, just clone the repo. I used the live server extension in VSCode to see my work in real time. I'll probably never deploy this to vercel or anything.

There's only an index.html file and a few JS files (eventually). This project is really just a way to get through all of the important js stuff before I really dig into the React/SQLite of the QB Sim. I'm also eventually adding three.js to the project in the far flung future to show action on screen, right now it's more akin to a pen and paper football sim.
