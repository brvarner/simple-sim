# simple-sim
A simplified vanilla js version of the Electron QB Sim, created to get my head around the logic.

So vanilla that it'd go great with mashed up oreo cookies. If you'd like to run it, just clone the repo. I used the live server extension in VSCode to see my work in real time.

There's only an index.html file and a few JS files (eventually). This project is really just a way to get through all of hte important js stuff before I really dig into the React/SQLite of the QB Sim, before I eventually add three.js to the project.
