# simple-sim

A simplified vanilla js version of the Electron QB Sim, created to get my head around the logic.

So vanilla that it'd go great with mashed up oreo cookies. I added npm and Jest to the project for testing purposes, so it's changed a bit since first commit.

## Development

If you'd like to run it locally, clone the repo and:\ 1.`npm install` (or `yarn install`) to install dependencies\ 2. `npm start` (or `yarn start`) to preview the app locally\ 3. `npm test` (or `yarn test`) to run the tests

### Motivation

This project started as a way to get through all of the important js logic before I really dig into the React/SQLite of the bigger QB Sim. But it's become a great exercise in learning more about the idiosyncrasies of ES6 like proxies, structured clones, classes, and more. I've also enjoyed creating tests for vanilla js with Jest.

I'm also eventually adding three.js to the project in the far flung future to show action on screen, right now it's more akin to a pen and paper football sim.
